# Week 5 Lab Report
In this week's lab report, students are required to research the commands less, find, or grep and provide 4 command-line options or alternatives.

I will focus on the grep command.

&nbsp;
## **Command 1: "-i"**
___
-i (ignore case): This option allows you to search for a pattern case-insensitively. For example, grep -i "hello" file.txt will match both "hello" and "Hello".

**Example 1:**

Command:
```bash
grep -i "all" ch7.txt
```
Output:
```bash
In this chapter, I take up dilemmas that today’s parents face in rearing young children. Throughout this book, we have touched on myriad forces that make contemporary parenting highly challenging. These include one-sided, contradictory messages in the parenting-advice literature; career pressures that impinge on parent involvement in children’s lives; abysmally weak American child-care services to assist employed parents in their child-rearing roles; cultural violence and excessive materialism permeating children’s worlds; schools with less than optimal conditions for children’s learning; and impediments to granting children with deﬁcits and disabilities social experiences that maximize their development. 
When we speak of self-esteem, we refer to the judgments we make of our own worth and the feelings associated with those judgments. People with high self-esteem, although recognizing their limitations, are fundamentally satisﬁed with their characteristics and competencies. Their self-conﬁdence, self-respect, and realistic appraisal of their current skills fortify them in the face of failure, motivating them to try hard to surmount challenges. 
By the school years, individual differences in self-esteem are clearly evident and strongly related to children’s everyday behaviors. That is, most school-age children are quite good at judging their own strengths and limitations. For example, children who agree with such statements as, “I’m good at schoolwork,” tend to achieve well academically; children who concur that “most kids like me” get along well with their classmates; and children who say that they’re “usually the one chosen for games” are more advanced in physical skills.1 Many parents sense this strong link between children’s self-esteem and accomplishment. Consequently, they may try to build their child’s self-esteem with praise and reassuring comments.
Although self-esteem and favorable development are related, high self-esteem does not necessarily cause effortful behavior and achievement. Rather, to help sustain good outcomes, self-esteem must be earned through commitment, responsibility, and mastery of meaningful skills.2 Children whose parents combine warmth with reasonable expectations for mature behavior feel especially good about themselves.3 Warm parenting lets children know that adults believe they can succeed. And ﬁrm but appropriate expectations prompt children to strive for attainable goals and to use those goals as reasonable standards against which to evaluate their behavior.
Parents who deliver praise not based on real attainment actually undermine their child’s development. It does not take long for most children to see through these false compliments and to question their self-worth. For others, this unconditional parental acceptance may contribute to an unrealistic, overly inﬂated sense of self-esteem, which is also linked to adjustment problems. In one study, second and third graders identiﬁed by their teachers as frequently teasing, starting ﬁghts with, and excluding other children were far more likely than their classmates to rate themselves as perfect on a self-esteem questionnaire.4 Their distorted view of their own competence appeared to undermine any motivation to improve their social behavior.
Finally, children don’t need to feel great about everything they try. None of us is adept in every area. Rather, during the school years, self-esteem differentiates into an array of self-evaluations. For example, children judge themselves to be good at some school subjects and physical skills but not so good at others. Eventually, they combine these separate self-evaluations into a general appraisal—an overall sense of self-esteem. It remains positive so long as the child feels that he or she is competent at some worthwhile skills.5 
In Chapter 2, I also noted that it is crucial for parents to model good viewing practices; to watch TV with children, helping them understand and evaluate what they see; and to use televised content as inspiration for make-believe play and other enriching activities. Another suggestion: Try not to use television to reward or punish children. This increases its attractiveness, making children want to watch all the more.
As I noted in Chapter 4, the computer, like TV, has just as much potential for good as for ill. Hence it’s another alluring device that requires close parental monitoring and intervention—to prevent children from becoming addictive users; from immersing themselves in violent, gender-stereotyped video games; and from accessing websites and web pages with sexual, aggressive, or other inappropriate content.
Almost all American public-school classrooms have at least one computer,8 and many preschools have them as well. But for the computer to enhance learning in early childhood, adults must guide children in its constructive use and help them acquire computer-literacy skills. Around 3 years of age, children can type in simple commands and play educational games. Although they like the computer, most preschoolers do not ﬁnd it so captivating that it diverts them from other worthwhile activities. 
A common parental worry is that computers will channel children into solitary pursuits and disrupt their social development. To the contrary, children generally prefer to use computers socially. At home, they often like to engage in computer activities with a parent or older sibling because they can do much more with the help of an expert partner. And at school, small groups often gather around the machine to solve problems collaboratively.
Beginning in the late preschool years, children can learn to program. Specially designed computer languages, such as LOGO, are available for this purpose. As long as adults provide the necessary scaffold, children beneﬁt greatly from programming experiences. They not only acquire a valuable new skill but master new concepts, become better problem solvers, and think more creatively.11 Also, since children must detect errors in their programs to get them to work, programming helps them reﬂect on their thinking and regulate their own behavior.12
How much is too much and how young is too young? There’s no evidence that computer experiences make toddlers more skilled computer users or thinkers. By kindergarten and primary school, children can gain much from computer activities. As far as how much computer time parents should permit, the answer depends on what children are doing. When they are involved in writing, problem solving, or other educational pursuits, there’s no special reason to be very restrictive. But not all software called “educational” is the same quality, so parents are wise to evaluate what their children are learning. Moreover, parents must ensure that time at the computer does not interfere with the variety of experiences children need to learn at their best. And playing violent video games and freely accessing the Internet should be prohibited.
Martha Bronson’s The Right Stuff for Children Birth to 813 is as an excellent resource for selecting play materials that provide children of varying ages with both pleasure and an appropriate challenge. On pages 138 to 141 of Chapter 4, I provided an overview of play-material suggestions for stimulating make-believe and game play in children between 2 and 8 years of age. In Bronson’s book, you’ll ﬁnd additional recommendations, organized into four broad play-activity categories: social and fantasy play; exploration and cognitive mastery; music, art, and movement; and gross motor play.
Children’s rooms and play spaces need not be ﬁlled with every toy imaginable. A modest number of toys is sufficient. Children who have too much typically care little for what they have. When given a chance to acquire something new, they usally don’t react with much excitement or selectivity. For materially indulged children, new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in. The child comes to think, if I don’t like what I just got, I can always discard it for something else. A bedroom or playroom heaped high with a jumble of toys, many broken and mistreated, also teaches children that possessions need not be cared for and respected. 
Nevertheless, preference is not the same as appropriateness. Children sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them. Other toys should not be given to children because they encourage undesirable play behaviors. Guns and other forms of weaponry fall into this category. In Chapter 4, I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both make-believe and real hostility in children’s interactions with peers.
When children do ask these questions, parents vary widely in how much information they are comfortable in providing. Up to age 8 or 9, most children are satisﬁed with such general explanations as it “starts as a little seed inside the mother, which grows into a baby,” “grows in a special space in the mother’s tummy called a uterus,” and “when the baby’s ready to be born, the mother’s uterus squeezes and squeezes, and the baby comes out.” Some parents show their child books with pictures of fetuses, identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the baby’s development as it progresses. There’s no evidence that this is in any way harmful or that it’s necessary during early childhood; rather, it’s a matter of parental choice.
Although spanking has declined over the past 50 years, the majority of parents in the United States admit to slapping or hitting their child for misbehaving.17 There is good reason not to believe in spanking. A great deal of research shows that it promotes only temporary compliance, not lasting changes in children’s behavior. Children who are repeatedly criticized, shouted at, and slapped are likely to display the unacceptable response again as soon as adults are out of sight and they can get away with it. In fact, children of harshly punishing parents develop into especially disobedient and aggressive youngsters. In a study of a national sample of over twelve hundred mothers of 6- to 9-year-olds, psychologists Murray Straus, David Sugarman, and Jean Giles-Sims found that the more spanking the mothers reported, the more antisocial behavior their children displayed two years later—cheating, telling lies, being mean to classmates, and disobeying teachers.18
Why doesn’t spanking work? First, when parents spank, they often do so in response to children’s deﬁance and aggression.19 Yet the punishment itself models aggression! Second, children who are frequently punished soon learn to avoid the punishing adult. When children evade their parents, they reduce parents’ opportunity to teach desirable behaviors. Finally, as spanking “works” to stop children’s misbehavior temporarily, it offers immediate relief to parents, which rewards them for spanking. For this reason, the parent is likely to spank with greater frequency and intensity over time, a course of action that can spiral into serious abuse.
But parents have far better ways to punish than spanking. One of these is time out—requiring a child to sit aside or to go to his or her room. Another is withdrawal of privileges, such as a visit to the playground or a weekly allowance. These mild punishments derive their potency from warm parent–child bonds. Children of involved, caring parents ﬁnd the interruption in parental affection that accompanies punishment to be very unpleasant. As a result, they want to regain the warmth and approval of the parent as quickly as possible.
An important preventive of misbehavior—and a vital element of effective punishment—is explanation. Pairing reasons with mild punishment (such as time out) leads to a far greater reduction in rule violations than using punishment alone.21 The reason the adult gives the child must match the child’s capacity to understand. At ages 2 to 3, referring to simple, direct outcomes works best, as in, “If you keep pushing Tommy, he’ll fall down and cry.” By age 4, parents can give more complex and subtle explanations. For example, they can refer to others’ intentions (“Don’t yell at Jessica. She was only trying to help”), to others’ feelings (“He’s proud of his tower, and you knocked it down; now he’s very sad”), and to issues of rights and fairness (“That toy belongs to Rudy, so you must ask for a turn”).22
Explaining to children what they did wrong, why it was wrong, and how they should have acted helps them recall the misdeed and relate it to expectations for future behavior. Furthermore, by pointing out the impact of the child’s actions on others, parents prompt children to feel empathy and sympathy—emotions that motivate concern for others.23 And giving children reasons for changing their behavior invites them to judge the appropriateness of parents’ expectations—to see that parents are not being arbitrary or autocratic. Explanations lead children to strive to meet parental standards because those standards make sense.
In sum, when time out is combined with reasoning, it remains effective through the school years. You can tell that your approach to discipline is working when time out and other punishments become less necessary as your child shifts from externally controlled responses to behavior based on inner standards and compassion for others. Typically this shift is well under way between ages 4 and 7.24 
If parents ﬁnd themselves punishing frequently, then they need to reconsider the basis of their discipline. When sensitivity, cooperation, and exchanges of affection are evident in parent–child interaction, children as young as 2 years of age more often follow parental directives.25 Children with an affectionate, mutually gratifying parental tie want to heed parents’ demands because they feel a sense of commitment to the relationship. This reduces the need for punishment, freeing parents to focus on encouraging children’s competent behavior.
Three additional ways to avoid excessive punishment are worth mentioning. First, changing aspects of the environment can reduce children’s problematic behavior. One parent arranged for her younger child to play at a friend’s house during his sister’s birthday party, realizing that the boy wasn’t yet ready to join in the party’s activities and would likely disrupt them. Second, a close look at the reasonableness of the rules can be helpful. Another parent caught herself before yelling, “Don’t roll down that hill!” at her daughter. She realized that the child was unlikely to hurt herself on the gentle, grassy slope and that any grass-stained clothing could easily be washed. With a moment of reﬂection, the parent backed off from an almost-delivered rebuke to allow a pleasurable play activity. Finally, sensitivity to children’s physical and emotional resources helps prevent inappropriate punishment. When children are tired, ill, or bored, they are likely to engage in attention-getting, disorganized, or otherwise improper behavior as a reaction to discomfort rather than as an affront to authority. In these instances, meeting the child’s needs makes more sense than punishing. 
It’s also important to ﬁgure out why these persistent tantrums are occurring. As the often-heard phrase “terrible twos” suggests, many people assume that tantrums are a fact of life for 2- and even 3-year-olds. Once toddlers acquire the ability to follow adult directives, one way they assert their autonomy is by resisting parents’ requests and demands, using the familiar refrain, “No!” And from time to time, toddlers lose control. When frustrated, they haven’t yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions. But parents who take mental notes for a day on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their child’’s tantrums really are. For most young children, eager, willing cooperation is much more common than opposition.26
If your child has been emotionally reactive and difficult to soothe since infancy, then temperament is probably a signiﬁcant contributor to his behavior. You’ll also want to consider whether any changes in your family or the child’s daily life might be sparking intense anxiety—marital conﬂict, divorce or remarriage, a new baby brother or sister, starting preschool or child care, or a parent going to work when the child is used to having him or her at home. Parenting practices can modify children’s temperaments and assist them in coping with stressful life events. Protection from family discord; extra parental warmth, affection, and pleasurable time together when the child is behaving well; and ﬁrm, calm, and consistent discipline will help. 
Most children build up to a tantrum gradually. Parents can tell it’s in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak. For example, if the child is about to “blow” while you’re out shopping, try involving the child in the shopping experience—pointing out things of interest to the child; asking the child to help you select and carry purchases; and reminding the child that after the shopping is ﬁnished, you are going to do something the child enjoys. When parents interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the child’s attention, they provide strategies children can use on their own to regulate emotion. If parents always wait to intervene after the child has become intensely distressed, it’s harder not only for the parent to calm the child but for the child to learn to calm down. And once the child regains emotional control, reassuring the child of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parent–child relationship and strengthens the child’s sense of security.
Make-believe play is an effective context in which preschoolers can practice what to do when frustrated. Parent and child can take turns acting out the “parent” and “child” roles. While playing the “child,” the parent can get upset. Then parent and child can come up with ways to help the “child” control intense feelings. Occasionally during make-believe, children send parents clear messages about disciplinary tactics they want and need to quell tantrums. In one instance, Sonja, a mother at wit’s end over her 4-year-old daughter Meredith’s frequent ﬁts of kicking and screaming, consulted a child psychologist. The psychologist had Meredith play the “mother” and Sonja play the “child.” 
As this question makes clear, some children are far harder to discipline than others. A child’s temperament affects the ease with which he or she will follow parental directives and listen to explanations. In Chapter 5, I indicated that the impulsivity and emotional reactivity of children with ADHD make them very hard to rear and often lead to strife-ridden adult–child relationships, which further reduce children’s cooperation. Willful, stubborn children are also challenging to discipline. They tend to evoke harsh punishment, which heightens their resistance. 
A seemingly stubborn child may feel so little anxiety that parental disapproval and mild punishment do not spark enough inner discomfort to motivate compliance. Consequently, parents of headstrong children must use ﬁrm, consistent discipline and repeatedly explain how to behave and why. At the same time, such parents must resist the temptation to engage in carping criticism, harshness, and force. A warm parent–child bond based on cooperation is especially vital for helping recalcitrant children internalize parents’ standards. It provides the obstinate youngster, who feels little or no anxiety when reprimanded, with an alternative foundation for meeting parents’ expectations: a desire to preserve a spirit of affection and harmony with the parent.27
Finally, looking for the “silver lining” in the child’s difficult disposition can help parents muster the fortitude needed to rear a child with a difficult disposition. Consider Carl, one of the most obstinate participants in a study of the combined impact that temperament and child rearing have on long-term development.28 Beginning in infancy, Carl rejected many routines and experiences, including baths, bedtime, and new foods. He shrieked, cried, and struggled to get away. Yet his parents regarded his emotional intensity as a sign of inner strength and vigor. They believed that if they were patient and ﬁrmly insistent, Carl would, in the end, adapt positively.
By the time Carl reached school age, he was doing remarkably well. The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively. He did well in school and became enthusiastically involved in several activities. One of these was playing the piano—lessons that he had asked for but (in his typical fashion) at ﬁrst disliked intensely. Carl’s mother had granted his request for piano instruction under one condition: that he stick to the lessons for six months. She held him to this agreement despite his protests, which gradually subsided. Carl came to love his introduction to music. His parents’ warmth, determination, and consistency had helped him gain control of his behavior and beneﬁt from new learning opportunities.
Parents of quiet children often wonder whether their youngster is developing normally. Preschoolers whose play and behavior are typically mature for their age but who prefer solitary, tranquil activities are probably doing just ﬁne, both cognitively and socially. As I indicated in Chapter 3, only certain kinds of nonsocial activity—aimless wandering; immature, repetitive motor action; and anxious hovering around peers without joining in their play—are cause for concern.29 Most play of quiet preschoolers is not of this kind. Instead, it is positive and constructive, consisting of such activities as art, make-believe play, puzzles, and block-building.
Our society places such a high value on sociability that adults often regard quiet reserve as a sign of maladjustment. Yet not all cultures see things this way. Chinese adults, for example, view quiet children very positively—as advanced in social maturity.30 Thai primary-school teachers also value restrained, persistent child behavior, and they regard children who would be average in activity level in the United States as poorly behaved and unmotivated.31 Equating an energetic pace and gregariousness with normality is a Western cultural phenomenon—one that does not match what we know about quiet, nonanxious children. Most are bright youngsters with intense interests who, when they do play with peers, show socally skilled behavior.32
Nevertheless, you might want to encourage a quiet, inactive child to engage in active play from time to time—to ensure healthy exercise and to broaden the child’s experiences. The best way to do this is to join the child in active games, such as tag, relay races, hide-and-seek, and throwing and catching. Creating a “zone” for learning—by ensuring that active play is fun, provides plenty of opportunity to practice physical skills, and is not overstimulating for the quiet child—will increase the success of these efforts. You won’t be able to transform a quiet child into a physical dynamo, but you can help the child learn to enjoy moderate physical activity. Finally, parents of quiet children may be gratiﬁed to learn that a calm, less active nature typically makes a child easier to rear.
Besides modeling destructive forms of interaction, parents who behave hurtfully toward each other generally interact hostilely with their children.35 They also tend to use inconsistent discipline—alternately strict and lax.36 When parents scold children on some occasions but permit them to act inappropriately on others, children are confused about how to behave and engage in especially high rates of disobedience.
In sum, parents behaving insolently to each other are up against a brick wall in getting a child to behave respectfully. They need to repair their relationship. Seeking the help of a marriage and family counselor without delay is the best way to prevent the child’s emotionally despondent and angry reactions from spiraling into lasting adjustment problems. 
The best way for parents to ensure that only children fare well is to engage them in development-enhancing dialogues, to impose reasonable expectations for mature behavior, and to discipline effectively. Overall, parents of only children are quite successful in attaining these child-rearing goals. Contrary to popular belief, only children are not destined to become spoiled and selﬁsh. Instead, research consistently shows that they are as well adjusted and as socially competent as other children. And they form just as close and as rewarding friendships as do children with siblings, suggesting that they can and do learn to share and to be considerate of others’ needs. Furthermore, only children have a more positive sense of self-esteem and do better in school than do children growing up in families with two or more children.37 
A major reason for these positive outcomes is that having just one child generally means a closer parent–child relationship; more time for high-quality parent–child interaction; and greater encouragement for mastery and accomplishment.38 But because only children lose the lifelong beneﬁts of positive sibling ties, parents might take steps to enrich the child’s life with sibling-like relationships—for example, by cultivating warm bonds with cousins or the children of close family friends. In sum, with good parenting, only children fare extremely well.
Children display wide individual differences in the quality of their sibling ties. Once again, temperament makes a difference. For example, arguments between siblings increase when one child is emotionally intense and highly active.39 But parents can do much to foster favorable sibling interaction. During the preschool years, mothers tend to be more positive and playful with second-borns than ﬁrst-borns, and they discipline the older child more.40 This differential treatment is understandable, in that older children are more competent and capable, so parents expect more. But being older also means more privileges—for example, being able to stay overnight at a friend’s house or enroll in certain after-school activities and lessons. These advantages may help compensate for an older child’s perception that a younger sibling is receiving better treatment. 
The elementary school years are a time when sibling conﬂict can increase. As children get feedback about how well they are doing in school and in other activities (such as sports and music lessons), parents may compare their accomplishments, especially when siblings are close in age and the same gender. The child who feels less valued is likely to resent a sibling whom parents seem to prefer. Therefore, when praising one child, parents should try not to diminish the merits of another. If a sibling expresses jealousy, parents can remind the envious child of an admirable personal trait or a recent commendable performance. But be careful not to give empty praise (not based on real accomplishment), which children quickly come to mistrust. It may fuel jealousy of a sibling, whom the child concludes parents really appreciate.
If your child’s language development is delayed by several months when compared to norms for early language milestones, then your child might have a language disorder. But keep in mind that children vary greatly in their pace of language learning. For example, girls are slightly ahead of boys in early vocabulary growth, and reserved, cautious children often wait until they understand a great deal before trying to speak.42 When they ﬁnally do speak, their vocabularies grow rapidly. 
The most common cause of early language problems is a hearing loss. Typically, children with hearing impairments are not identiﬁed until 12 to 25 months of age, when speech and language development is already delayed. Therefore, ASHA recommends that all newborn babies be screened for hearing disorders before they leave the hospital. Newborn testing takes only a few minutes and permits problems to be addressed early, preventing negative consequences for all aspects of psychological development.
Hearing loss can also emerge later. The most common cause during toddlerhood and the preschool years is repeated otitis media, or middle ear infection. Some episodes are painful, so parents detect them, but many are accompanied by few or no symptoms. Children with recurrent otitis media bouts have trouble making out what others are saying. Hence they are distractible, behind in language progress, and socially isolated; and they also achieve poorly in school.43 
When children begin preschool or child care, they are more susceptible to otitis media because of close contact with other children. Therefore, frequent screening for the disease, followed by prompt medical intervention, is vital. Interestingly, verbally stimulating adult–child interaction and high-quality child care help reduce developmental problems associated with otitis media.44 When adults converse often with children and keep environmental noise to a minimum, children with persistent ear infections have more opportunities to hear and respond to spoken language.
Although many teachers believe that a 5-year-old who’s on the young side can beneﬁt from waiting another year before enrolling in kindergarten and advise parents to hold the child out, research has not revealed any advantages for delayed entry. A host of studies indicate that younger children make just as much progress, academically and socially, as do older children enrolled in the same grade. No difference exists between younger and older classmates in achievement test scores.45 
As long as teachers are sensitive to children’s diversity and work with small groups and individual children within their “zones,” there is no reason to hold a child out of kindergarten. Deciding not to enroll a child and opting for an alternative experience is justiﬁable only when the kindergarten environment is so rigid and unaccommodating to individual differences that the child would be frustrated and unhappy and would have an unproductive year. 
American parents often express uncertainty about helping their child with homework. They worry that by providing help, they will discourage self-reliance in thinking and problem solving. Vygotsky’s concept of the “zone” underscores that children acquire the many capacities they need to learn autonomously from the assistance of parents, teachers, and other more expert adults. By collaborating with the child on a challenging task, the adult assesses what the child can already do and what the child is ready to learn, providing a support system for mastery.
The metaphor of a scaffold, discussed in Chapter 2, is an excellent guide for how to help your child with homework. Scaffolding involves varying your assistance to ﬁt the child’s changing competence. When the child says, “I don’t understand,” you can adjust the task, breaking it into smaller parts. You can also provide prompts, hints, and explanations, increasing the amount and directiveness of your guidance until the child makes progress. As you do so, you can assist the child in analyzing why certain problem-solving approaches work and others do not, encouraging her to come up with ideas for surmounting difficulties. As she starts to apply the strategies derived from your dialogue, you can reduce the intensity of your intervention, letting her take over responsibility for the task.
Too often, parents imagine that their child’s classmates can do the homework assignment independently. After all, they say to themselves, why would the teacher have assigned it if this weren’t so? This pattern of reasoning leads parents down a counterproductive path. “What’s wrong with my child?” they say to themselves. “She should be able to do the assignment, just like everyone else!” But recal that children of the same age differ widely in their “zones.” And rooted in the very idea of the “zone” is that learning requires teaching! Children in our culture frequently are rebuked for seeking help, a response that promotes dependency, helplessness, and retreat from challenge, not competence and autonomy. 
Throughout elementary school, girls get better grades in math—and other academic subjects—than do boys. At times, school-age boys outperform girls on math achievement tests,52 but boys’ advantage in math isn’t clearly evident until secondary school. A close look at children’s performance on speciﬁc test items reveals that both genders do equally well in basic math knowledge, and girls do better in computational skills. Boys’ advantage appears on tests of math reasoning, primarily on complex word problems and in geometry.53
Although heredity may contribute to boys’ spatial superiority, experience also makes a difference. Children who engage in manipulative activities involving spatial relations, such as block play, model building, and carpentry, do better on spatial reasoning tasks. Also, playing video games that require rapid mental rotation of visual images enhances the spatial test scores of boys and girls alike.57 Yet boys spend far more time at all these pursuits than do girls.
Also, subtle feedback from adults undermines girls’ conﬁdence in their ability to do well at math. If a parent or teacher believes that a child is not very capable at a school subject, the adult may act surprised when the child succeeds, ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this: “Gee, you did a lot better than I expected!” And when the child fails, the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability: “You’re not very good at that, are you?” Girls get much more of this type of feedback than do boys, especially in math.60 In contrast, parents and teachers often attribute boys’ poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation. “If only you’d listen and try,” they say, “you’d do much better.”
As a result of these messages, too many girls come to believe that when they succeed at math, their ability didn’t help them. And after failure, they reason that weak ability, not insufficient effort, was at fault. Children who hold these discouraging explanations for their performance often come apart with anxiety when a task is difficult. They say to themselves, “I can’t do this! It’s too hard!” before they have really tried.61 Although eventually young people ﬁgure out that effort can compensate for low ability, girls may conclude that mastering complex math is not worth the cost—extremely high effort.62 So in high school, they retreat from advanced math courses and math-related careers.
By secondary school, girls’ advantage on tests of general verbal ability is so slight that it is not really meaningful.68 Consequently, boys who are free of reading disabilities have the potential to achieve just as well as girls in reading and writing. Still, girls continue to outperform boys in these subjects. Home and school experiences contribute, although less is known about them than those that underlie boys’ advantage in mathematics. 
Just as children think of math as a masculine subject, they regard reading and writing as feminine subjects. Parents rate daughters as more capable at reading than they rate sons—beliefs that children adopt. 69 Furthermore, traditional primary-school classrooms, in which teacher-directed, whole-class lessons are the major activity, require children to sit still and concentrate for long periods of time on academic tasks that often are irrelevant to their interests. In previous chapters, I indicated that such classrooms are poorly suited to the learning needs of both boys and girls. But boys adapt especially poorly to the regimentation of traditional classrooms because of their generally shorter attention spans, higher activity levels, and less compliant dispositions.Consequently, they often are targets of teacher disapproval, which sparks negative attitudes toward school and dampens their enthusiasm for learning.70
In a recent Australian study carried out by psychologist Freda Briggs, several hundred schoolchildren were asked for their views on school and classroom activities. Many boys between 5 and 9 years of age expressed dissatisfaction with school and said that their favorite activities were recess and lunchtime. But in four classrooms, distinguished by an activity-center curriculum offering opportunities for individual choice, small-group work, and literacy experiences responsive to children’s interests, boys reported strong liking for school. And they named reading and writing as their favorite activities. They particularly enjoyed making their own books, based on themes of sports and hobbies.71
Although more evidence is needed to be sure, perhaps classrooms that create “zones” for learning, with many of the features I described in Chapter 6, spark sufficient enthusiasm for literacy pursuits among boys that they reduce the well-known gender gap in reading and writing achievement. Finally, the trend for boys to learn to read more slowly than girls is less pronounced in countries where reading is not stereotyped as feminine but regarded as well suited to the masculine gender role.72
Divorce is invariably painful for children, and learning and development can be affected—temporarily and long term.73 Preschool and young school-age children are often profoundly upset. Because they have great difficulty grasping the reasons for their parents’ divorce, they may blame themselves and take the marital breakup as a sign that they could be abandoned by both parents. As a result, they may cry and cling, refuse to go to school, and show a drop in enthusiasm for play and learning. Young children need extra affection and reassurance along with gentle reminders that their parents’ separation is permanent. Of all age groups, preschoolers are most likely to have trouble accepting the reality of divorce and to fantasize that their parents will get back together.74
Many school-age children and adolescents also react strongly to the end of their parents’ marriage, particularly when family conﬂict is high and parent involvement with children is low. Around the time of divorce and for up to several years after, children tend to be emotionally volatile, displaying both depression and demandingness, noncompliance, and aggression.75 Boys in mother-custody families seem to have the hardest time. Research reveals that before the marital breakup, many sons of divorcing couples were impulsive and deﬁant—traits that may have contributed to as well as been caused by their parents’ marital problems. Thus, boys often enter the period of family turmoil surrounding divorce with behavior problems and a reduced capacity to cope with stress.76 Custodial mothers tend to have difficulty handling sons on their own. Both boys and girls show declines in academic achievement during the aftermath of divorce, but school problems are greater for boys.77
Your child’s intellectual growth will deﬁnitely continue as long as you and other important adults in his life promote it. Chapter 5 of this book is devoted to the development of children with deﬁcits and disabilities. Although I don’t discuss children with cerebral palsy speciﬁcally, the same general principles for fostering continued learning in all children apply to your child. Children—with and without disabilities—acquire new competencies through dialogues with more expert partners, who are sensitive to what the child is ready to master and foster it in culturally meaningful activities.
All too often, children’s disabilities are viewed as entirely biological, much like an incurable disease. Vygotsky’s theory emphasizes that the most serious consequence of a physical or mental defect is not the biological impairment itself but the disruption it causes in the child’s social relationships. You can help your child compensate for his physical limitations through social contact and communication aimed at strengthening the higher thought processes—voluntary attention, deliberate memory, concept formation, logical reasoning, problem solving, and imagination. “The mightiness of the mind,” Vygotsky wrote, “has virtually no limits.”81

To find this command I asked ChatGPT. My prompt was: "give me the easiest/simplest command-line options to use with grep". I made sure my commands worked with command line after seeing the results.

&nbsp;
## **Command 2: "-r"**
___
-r (recursive search): This option allows you to search for a pattern recursively in all files within a directory. For example, grep -r "hello" /path/to/directory will search for "hello" in all files within the specified directory.

**Example 1:**

Command:
```bash
grep -r "Lucayans" written_2/
```
Output:
```bash
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:Centuries before the arrival of Columbus, a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas. Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
```

In bash, every instance of "Lucayans" within the written_2 directory is highlighted. The -r command is useful because it recursively searches through every file in a given directory for a specified word. 

**Example 2:**

Command:
```bash
grep -r "Port Canaveral on Florida" written_2/
```
Output:
```bash
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Many cruises to the Bahamas depart from Port Canaveral on Florida’s east coast, about halfway up the peninsula. This is an ideal jumping off point for a number of attractions of worldwide fame — the pleasures of Orlando and Walt Disney World and other theme parks are only 50 minutes away. Even closer, just 20 minutes away from the cruise port, is Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center.
```
In bash, every instance of "Port Canaveral on Florida" within the written_2 directory is highlighted. The -r command is useful because it recursively searches through every file in a given directory for a specified word.

&nbsp;
## **Command 3: "-n"**
___
-n (line numbers): This option shows the line numbers of the matching lines. For example, grep -n "hello" file.txt will show the line numbers of the lines containing "hello".

**Example 1:**

Command:
```bash
grep -n "contributed" ch2.txt
```
Output:
```bash
237:What factors contributed to Hannah’s turnabout? Shared understanding (intersubjectivity) between adult and child, scaolding of new competencies, narrative conversations prompting a redeﬁnition of self, and joint engagement in culturally meaningful activities—the diverse experiences we have considered that create the zone of proximal development—appear to be at the heart of her success story. Indeed, Hannah’s tale suggests that young children denied these supports can still proﬁt from them later, if such supports are available and they have the fortitude to capitalize on them. But not all young people are as fortunate as Hannah. Some remain profoundly impaired by inadequate adult investment in their childhoods. And even those who fare reasonably well may carry with them inner wounds—a sense of emptiness and regret at having missed self-deﬁning, conﬁdence-inducing early experiences that cannot, in the ﬁnal analysis, be recaptured.
```

In bash, every line with the phrase "contributed" is given within the file ch2.txt, with the specified word highlighted. The -n command is useful because it only gives you the line with the word/phrase you are searching for, making file parsing more easier for specific words.

**Example 2:**

Command:
```bash
grep -n "attributed" ch2.txt
```
Output:
```bash
233:Hannah completed her degree the following year. In a letter she wrote to Eva and Charlie shortly after her graduation, she attributed her turnabout in motivation and self-conﬁdence to the connection, forged through dialogue, with her aunt and uncle:

&nbsp;
## **Command 4: "-w"**
___
-w (word-matching): This option matches only complete words, rather than patterns that are part of a larger word. For example, grep -w "hello" file.txt will only match lines containing the word "hello", but not "hello there".

**Example 1:**

Command:
```bash
grep -w "the" China-WhatToDo.txt

Most visitors to China come to see the nation’s many excellent historic and cultural sites, including the imperial treasures. But there is much else of interest in this vast land to make the journey truly enjoyable. You will of course want to bring home at least a few souvenirs, and you will have opportunities to attend presentations of an incredible range of performing arts. It will not be difficult to fill your moments of leisure with memorable activities that will make your trip last well after you return home.
After watching coachloads of foreign tourists clamoring to buy souvenirs at every stop, from the Forbidden City to the oases of Xinjiang, the Chinese authorities have opened shops wherever visitors go. The Friendship Stores, found in all significant tourist locations, make for easy shopping. They are essentially for foreigners only, and salespeople speak several languages and usually have all the patience in the world for repetitive queries. Foreign money may be changed on the premises, and some credit cards are accepted.
But more adventurous travelers might stumble across the same items in a neighborhood store. There the scene is less relaxed and the language problem might daunt you, but at least you’ll be able to catch a glimpse of Chinese consumer society.
In many cities, arts and crafts department stores showcase the output of local artisans. Antiques shops specialize in old pottery, jewelry, carvings, and calligraphy, as well as high-quality reproductions.
Since the distribution system is unpredictable, old China hands say you shouldn’t take a chance: if you find something you like, buy it, for it might not be on sale anywhere else. Prices are as marked; do not try to bargain.
Antiques. From fossils to ancient coins, Chinese customs regulations prohibit the export of any cultural relics except those marked with special wax seals; and only fairly recent objects are given the seal. Even so, browsing is fascinating. Remember that many knowledgeable buyers will have preceded you. The authorities here peg prices to international levels.
Bamboo products. In the southern regions where bamboo grows, cottage industries turn out bamboo tea boxes, fans, flutes, chopsticks, walking sticks, and furniture.
Brocades and silk. Since the Han Dynasty, China has been exporting delicate silk fabrics in brilliant colors. These days you can buy inexpensive raw silk by the meter or exquisite brocades, as well as silk scarves, ties, and blouses.
Bronzeware. Modern versions of traditional hotpots are useful in the home, as are bronze pitchers, plates, and vases (often engraved with intricate dragon or floral designs).
China (porcelain). Reproductions of classical designs or modern teapots, cups, plates, and vases. Shrewd buyers point out that price tags always indicate the excellence of porcelain (and of cloisonne ware, too). In the line of Chinese text before the actual price, look for the Chinese symbols for the numerals 1, 2, or 3 (one, two, or three horizontal lines), meaning first, second, or third class. If there’s no number at all, it means first class.
Chopsticks. Now that you’re becoming familiar with Chinese cooking, you might want to collect the appropriate utensils. Elaborate chopsticks are sold in their own fitted carrying cases — handy for a picnic or an emergency.
Fans. One factory in Hangzhou alone manufactures 10 million fans per year, most of them for export. They come in several hundred varieties, but the best known folding fans are made of fragrant sandalwood or black paper.
Figurines. Ceramic polychrome figurines of historic or legendary personages are popular, as are little animals, with the panda the most sought after.
Furniture. Boxwood, mahogany, or bamboo screens, chairs, and chests with elaborately carved designs re-create the atmosphere of old China. Shipping abroad can be arranged.
Furs. Glossy sable or marten coats are often displayed in Friendship Stores. The styling might not be the latest fashion, but the price tag could make all the difference.
Ginseng. The all-purpose Chinese medicinal herb is becoming well known in the West as a tonic. Small doses of ginseng in tea, wine, or soup are claimed to be the secret of enduring vitality.
Herbs and spices. Every market has stands selling fragrant spices. Look above all for varieties particular to the region; in Chongqing, for instance, you might buy Sichuan dried peppers. A few fen will buy an exotic gift, especially welcome when the herbs or spices are unknown or unavailable at home.
Ivory. Carvings of remarkable intricacy are a Chinese specialty. But only an expert can distinguish between a genuine tusk and substitute material. Obtaining real ivory, of course, means the slaughter of elephants, and today almost all import of ivory products has been banned. If in doubt, check with your consulate first.
Jade. One of the hardest of stones, jade has intrigued the Chinese for at least 3,000 years. Even if you don’t believe in its mystic powers, jade’s aesthetic appeal cannot be denied.
Lacquerware. Numerous layers of lacquer, individually polished, are applied to trays, cups, vases, and boxes. Lacquer also makes the ideal finish for tea and coffee services, since the material resists boiling water as well as the chemicals in tea and coffee.
Luggage. One answer to the problem of excessive buying might be to buy additional luggage to carry your souvenirs home. The Chinese make good, cheap, sturdy suitcases of all sizes. Or you can pick up a local imitation of a Western executive attaché case.
Paintings. Squadrons of artists copy the traditional drawings and paintings by hand. A lengthy scroll can take as long as ten days to complete, brushstroke by brushstroke, with the details of a landscape intended to be viewed in sections, not all at once. Artists also produce original meditations on venerable themes. The scrolls have the advantage of being already rolled up for packing.
Paper art. The Chinese, who invented paper, are thought to have devised the decorative art of paper cutting nearly 2,000 years ago. With great skill, scissors-wielding paper cutters produce intricate scenes suitable for framing.
Rubbings and reproductions. Stone rubbings of inscriptions from ancient temples, or of classical calligraphy on stone pillars, make popular (and portable) souvenirs. In some museums you will find shops selling reproductions of their most famous archaeological exhibits (for example, the flying horse in Lanzhou). Tiny facsimiles of the Xi’an warriors are now available in many parts of the country.
Seals. These ink stamps (also called “chops”) are the traditional Chinese substitute for handwritten signatures. You can have one carved just for you, with your name incised — perhaps in ancient Chinese block characters — in soapstone, plastic, jade, or ivory.
After a grueling day of sightseeing, you might not be too disappointed to discover that an evening’s entertainment starts and ends early. Nightlife stays on a high cultural plane, far removed from the nightclub scene of Europe or North America. Chinese performances combine amusement with edification in a glittering package few Western impresarios could afford to mount.
The Chinese hospitably assume that foreigners can’t bear more than about ten minutes of traditional Chinese opera. You might, indeed, find the voices shrill and the mannerisms maddening (many characters seem to spend most of the time fussing with their sleeves, which can unroll to the floor). So you should not mind if your guide or host rushes you out of the theater into the early evening traffic.
But if you persevere, you will begin to understand what the Chinese see in this age-old art form. If you fail, you’ve still enjoyed the splendid costumes and makeup, the acrobatics that enliven some regional versions, and the experience of being in a theater surrounded by local people. Peking opera is the version most familiar to Westerners, but other regions have their own variants.
If possible, familiarize yourself with the plot in advance. Ideologically uplifting operas were the only ones permitted during the Cultural Revolution; classical stories were banned. But today both classical and modern works are presented. If you have an interpreter at hand, you’ll understand why some scenes animate the audience and others don’t. The words of the songs are projected onto screens alongside the proscenium arch to clarify the nuances of a tonal language set to music. Apart from the set pieces, most of the music is percussive and serves to support and reflect the action and mood.
Props are minimal and the action is subtle: an actor closes an invisible door with a mime gesture, and anyone walking with a riding crop must be understood to be mounted on a horse. But the heroic characters couldn’t ever be mistaken for the snarling villains.
Popular with adults and children, the Chinese shadow play (a 2,000-year-old art form) dramatizes familiar legends. The two-dimensional puppets, manipulated behind a silk screen, can jump and fly, giving the colorful silhouettes an advantage over the actors in Chinese opera. The busy puppeteers give voice to their characters, often in song. Professional and amateur shadow-play troupes also put on shows with marionettes.
The so-called acrobatic shows, staged for tourist groups, are more fun than you might expect. The trapeze artists, of course, are first-class, and so are the contortionists and human pyramid acts. But they also throw in jugglers and magicians and even comics, and you don’t have to understand a word to join in the laughter.
Typically, the “Chinese folklore” performances are organized especially for tourists. Shows feature the costumes, songs, and dances of the national minority groups — often as foreign to a Chinese audience as they are to visitors from abroad. These evenings are usually uplifting and not very long.
During the Cultural Revolution, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky were banned and many musicians banished to the countryside for “re-education.” So if you go to a concert today, you’ll sense the drama of recovery from mad xenophobia. This needn’t obscure the fact that some professional musicians haven’t yet reached world standards. But the enthusiasm of players and audience is exciting in itself.
Ballet, a vehicle for ideological indoctrination during the 1960s and 1970s, is much less restricted today. Folk legends are often a source of inspiration, and classical European works are sometimes performed, with elaborate costumes, sets, and lighting effects.
With varying degrees of success, the tourist hotels try to meet foreigners’ demands for a quiet place to have a drink and a chat. Only the newest hotels that were built with international cooperation contain bars reminiscent of those in Europe or America. The others are likely to be quaint rather than cozy.

Command:

grep -w "bear" Canada-History.txt
```
Output:
```bash
In the Arctic region, the stabilization of the sea level and a dramatic cooling of the climate around 1500 b.c. caused hunters to switch from land mammals to fish, seal, walrus, whale, and ice-dwelling polar bear. At the same time, these ancestors of the Inuit moved out of their skin tents into warmer igloos of hardened snow blocks. They glided over the ice on skates of ivory or antler horn. From the Yukon, further migrations took them north to the High Arctic, south around Hudson Bay to Manitoba, east to Greenland, and down the Labrador coast to Newfoundland.
For these great hunters of the Rocky Mountain foothills and prairies, wild game included grizzly and black bear, antelope, deer, elk, wild sheep, and goats, but the only “real meat” was buffalo. Before the early 1700s, when horses appeared on the scene, guile was more important than speed, and hunters stalked the buffalo herd disguised with the skins of wolf and buffalo calves. Horseback hunting brought new skills and prestige to an élite that had been given no other duties. The Blackfoot went to war with Shoshoni and Crow Indians, to the south, for their horses, and were in turn attacked by the Cree from the north for their territory’s great buffalo herds. Buffalo was everything to these tribes — food, clothes, and tents; and twelve to fourteen buffalo skins were needed to construct a single teepee. So the cultural and ecological shock was all the greater when the herds were exterminated in the 1870s. Métis and Cree Indians were devastatingly efficient with their repeater rifles, and the transcontinental railway builders made a deliberate policy of clearing the tracks of migrating buffalo. By 1877, under the Canadian government’s Blackfoot Treaty, the native peoples gave up their hunting grounds to raise cattle on reserves instead.
Like their Algonquin cousins back in the woodlands of Québec and Ontario, they showed a great talent for hunting — moose, beaver, bear, caribou, and seal — with bow and arrow, traps, and harpoon. Before the hunt, the Micmac staged a huge “eat-all” feast to clear out all available provisions, confident the larder would be amply replenished. When they returned, the hunting dogs ended up as the prize delicacy for guests at their ceremonial feasts. The hunters lured the moose with a birchbark “horn” imitating the female call, and if that didn’t work, they poured water from a birchbark receptacle into a pond to reproduce the sound of the female urinating. Once the men had killed the beast, the women had to carry it home to cook. The choice morsel was the head, roasted.
